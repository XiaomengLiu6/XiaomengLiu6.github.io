## This is my first blog post for the differing among DS, statistician and Machine Learning.

What do you think being a data scientist is about?  
# Being a data scientist is about fitting a model to the massive data collected. It needs data analyzing skills and data cleaning skills.
What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas?  
The major duties are about programming, data visualization and commnuication.
What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?
The differences are ":" 1) data size are smaller for statisticians; 2) collecting data is only concered for statistician; 3) Data scientists are fitting model into data and statisticians are fitting data into model.
The similarities are ":" 1) They both require understanding of statistical concepts and methods; 2) programming knowledge; 3) provide feedback by analyzing data.
How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?
I feel that I would spend more efforts into data science area, since I prefer using my knowledge to sole real issues related to business. 

```tsql
SELECT *
FROM sys.tables
WHERE [name] = 'SomeTable'
```
