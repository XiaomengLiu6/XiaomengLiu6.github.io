This is a brief blog post for project2.

In the project, I define the functions to find 2 end points and 4 modifications for NASA API. CMS analysis data and asteriod data are collected throughout the process. The main research question is whether there is a difference between 2015 and 2023. I expect that there would be a huge difference since the data from a decade ago should not be as good as what we have today. However, the results suprise me and there is not much difference. I would say that the data today is wider in range and has more observations. But I forgot the fact that the nature is not changing. The total amount of asteriods, for example, is not changing. Then we are making less mistakes of missing some of them.

Yes, first of all, I have learned a lot about the API. I am more familiar with APIs. Programmingwise, I have learned that generating functions is a complicated process and it is always better to have testing along with it. In future, I would not start with design a long function. I would design many short functions and put them together at the end. Looking for problems in the long function is really painful.
