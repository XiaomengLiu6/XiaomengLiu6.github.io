This is the post for project 3 ST558.

The project is related to a Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset.
The subsets of the data are created according to the education levels.
By automation of creating md files, we generate 5 .md files for different education levels.
A EDA and model selction has been made in each file. 6 methods are used to find the best model.
The best of the six best models is selected as the final best model for each education level.

Personally, I would take a look at the teammate or coworker's work each time they updated. I left those to be checked at the end of project.
His code works good but it took a long time for me to go through everything he had since this is a long project. If I could check the code
every time, it would save a lot of time for understanding at the end. So I would go through the coworker's code earlier next time, at least
not when they are finished.

The most difficult thing here is to correct some mistakes I made on the github. I forgor to only render the md file so I had to manually delete 
all the md and html file. Then rerender the files. The process of deleteing, pulling, and pushing is hard to make no mistake. I feel nervous 
doing that. 

The biggest take-away would be how powerful the github page is for rendering. It creates a nice website with not much effort. I do not need to
know much about creating a website and the linkes could be easily generated for each seperated md files. It is magical that we could just access 
those pages from the main page.
