1. write up the strategy you use for EDA.
I will do a data analysis for the data we have. The data will be identified with class and checked for missing values. Then, according to its type, a summary of statistics or contengency table would be applied to list out all information. After that, correlation among the variables will be studied. At the end, data visualization would be a useful tool to show what we find from the data. 

2. What is your overall goal when doing an EDA?
My overall goal would be to figure out basic characteristics about the data, which would be helpful for further analysis.

3. What methods do you think are important?
Important: visualization, data type, contingency table, numerical summary, and the correlation.

4. What things do you try to look for?
I will be looking for any useful information about the data. I need to understand the data better for each of its variables and each of its observations. The similarity, difference, and correlation among all data are the things I will be looking for particularly.
